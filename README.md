This is a  Psychovisual analysis on modern lossy image codecs

I have performed an study on image compression concentrating on lossy formats taking into account the psychovisual differences between original and compressed image.I would like to extend my gratitude to members for their valuable feedback in a previous thread.

For the study i have used butteraugli and ssimulacra to perform the psychovisual analysis.

Note :

Compression Rate(%) - Difference in % between the compression image and the original test image

Reference Compression Rate(%) - Difference in % between the compression image and a reference jpeg(i.e libjpeg encoded image of original image @ quality = 93).

Test images used in the image were from Jyrki Alakuijala image corpus : https://goo.gl/cmHIkl

The attachments include the data in csv files + plots + a bash script to automate the test.

Awaiting your feedback...

Kind Regards,
Khavish
